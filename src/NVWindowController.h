/// Acts as a controller object that coordinates between a Neovim process and a
/// NVGridView. User input is forwarded to the Neovim process. Grids obtained
/// from the process are rendered by a NVGridView.
///
/// Each NVWindowController object manages a connection to a remote Neovim
/// instance. Once a remote connection has been established, the window is
/// displayed. The controller is retained until the remote process exits and
/// its corresponding window is closed.
