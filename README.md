## Roadmap
 * Externalized tab bar.

 * Proper input method handling.
 * Ligature support.

## Building from Source
Neovim for macOS uses a forked version of
[Neovim](https://github.com/JaySandhu/neovim/tree/release-0.4-patched) which adds:
 * Native clipboard support (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12452).
 * A mousescroll option (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12355).
 * Scrolling fixes (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12356).

We'll also be building our modified version of Neovim, so before we begin, ensure you have the
[build perquisites](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#build-prerequisites).
Building is as simple as:

```
git clone https://github.com/JaySandhu/neovim-mac.git
cd neovim-mac
./build_nvim.sh
xcodebuild -configuration Release
```

If everything went as planned, you'll find Neovim.app in build/release.
